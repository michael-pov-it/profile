# mike-g profile

Personal site styled as a retro terminal. Each section looks like the ops tool that fits it: an SSH login message and `git log` on the home page, `htop` for books, `traceroute` for travel, a CI pipeline for languages, `btop` for sport and `systemctl` for hobbies.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000
npm test        # unit tests + content validation
npm run build   # production build (fails on invalid content)
```

Deploys are manual: Actions → **Deploy to Azure Container Apps** → **Run workflow**. Pushing to `main` deploys nothing. The one-time Azure setup and the `mike.euhub.co` domain steps are in [`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md). Project history and context are in [`docs/CONTEXT.md`](docs/CONTEXT.md).

## Editing content

Everything lives in `content/`. Add one Markdown file per entry. The file name becomes the URL, so use lowercase words joined by hyphens, like `content/travel/2025-04-japan.md`. Frontmatter goes between the `---` lines; the rest of the file is Markdown notes. Use `###` for headings inside notes.

Dates are `"YYYY-MM"` (or `"YYYY"`, or `"YYYY-MM-DD"` for sport events). Quote times like `"44:12"`, or YAML reads them as numbers.

If a file is invalid, `npm test` and `npm run build` fail with the file name and the field to fix.

### Before going live

- Replace every sample entry. `grep -rl "sample: true" content/` lists them, and they show a `sample` tag on the site.
- `siteUrl` in `content/profile.md` is `https://mike.euhub.co`. Point the domain at the Container App before announcing it (see `infra/README.md`).
- Check `home` in `content/profile.md`. It's the origin for travel distances and currently set to Bratislava.

### Fields

| Folder | Required | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `profile.md` | `name`, `handle`, `host`, `role`, `home {city, countryCode, lat, lng}`, `contact.email` | `uptime`, `siteUrl`, `certifications`, `contact.handler`, `contact.phone`, `contact.whatsapp` |
| `career/` | `company`, `role`, `start` | `end` (leave out while current) |
| `books/` | `title`, `author`, `status` (`reading` / `paused` / `finished` / `queued`), `languages` (list of `EN` / `RU` / `UA` / `SK`, the language(s) you read it in) | `progress` 0–100 (required for reading/paused), `started`, `finished` (books without one are listed under "finished earlier"), `rating` 1–5, `published`, `readTitle` (the title on the copy you read), `titleIsTranslation: true` (when `title` is your own catalog translation, not an official title), `tags` |
| `travel/` | `title`, `country`, `countryCode` (e.g. `JP`), `start`, `cities` (list of `{ name, lat, lng }`) | `days` |
| `languages/` | `name`, `level`, `target` (CEFR `A1`–`C2`, target ≥ level), `since` | `methods`, `streakDays` |
| `sport/` | `name`, `unit`, `weekly` (2–52 numbers, oldest first) | `records` (`{ label, value, date }`), `events` (`{ name, date, result }`, no result = scheduled), `streakDays`, `active` |
| `hobbies/` | `name`, `description`, `state` (`active` / `inactive`), `since` (when it entered that state) | |

All collections also accept `sample: true` for placeholder entries.

## Admin panel

`/admin` is a private page for adding and editing the entries in `content/` from a form, with sign-in by passkey or password. It is off unless `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` (32 or more characters) is set. Production setup and the secrets are in [`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md).

Try it locally:

```bash
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48) ADMIN_SETUP_TOKEN=local-setup npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000/admin/setup, use the token "local-setup", create an account
```

On another port, also set `ADMIN_ORIGIN=http://localhost:<port>`; the panel refuses requests from any other origin.

Locally the account lives in `.admin-dev/` (ignored by git) and saves go straight into `content/`, so the dev server shows them at once. In production the account is in Azure Table Storage and saves are commits to GitHub; **Publish** then starts the deploy.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` | Signs session cookies. Required, 32+ characters. |
| `ADMIN_ORIGIN` | Public origin, e.g. `https://mike.euhub.co`. Required in production (https only); passkeys are bound to its host. Defaults to `http://localhost:3000` in development. |
| `ADMIN_SETUP_TOKEN` | Key for the one-time `/admin/setup` page. Remove it after setup. |
| `ADMIN_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` | Azure Table Storage for the account. Required in production; development uses a file. |
| `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_GITHUB_REPO`, `ADMIN_GITHUB_BRANCH` | Where saves are committed and which workflow Publish starts. Without a token, production cannot edit or publish. |

## Keyboard

`1`–`6` switch sections, `j`/`k` move between items, `Enter` opens, `t` switches theme (crt / printout), `?` shows help.
